# Overview

I use Github Action for CI and ArgoCD for CD.

Each application (service) has 2 parts:

- Source code: we keep the source code, and CI definitions in its repo.

- K8S service definitions: To deploy to K8S, each application needs a definition, here weâ€™re using Helm as a template engine. These Helm charts, we manage them in a single repo [ipToolkits-applications](https://github.com/naviat/ipToolkits-applications). Whenever you want to increase/decrease resources or change configuration variables of an application, you can make modification there and send PR to DevOps for review.

## CI - How to trigger deployments?

I have some basic steps for a standard CI pipeline, including lint, and unit test ... besides of step to build Docker image and scan Docker image before push to registry.
In the production environment, we should add some steps like SonarQueue to report the code coverage.

To trigger a deployment to Dev, just merge the code to the `main` branch after reviewing and testing carefully.

To deploy to other non-prod environments, just tag `{env}.{year}.{week}.{deployment_number}`

To deploy to Production, use tag `{project_name}.{year}.{week}.{deployment_number}`

| Env       | How to trigger CI                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Dev       | Merge PR to main branch                          |
| Sandbox   | In main branch                                   |
|           | `git tag sandbox.2024.16.1`                      |
|           | `git push origin sandbox.2024.16.1`              |
| Production| In main branch                                   |
|           | `git tag iptools.2024.16.1`                      |
|           | `git push origin iptools.2024.16.1`              |

## ArgoCD

I will use localhost ArgoCD as is, this deployment will go with this repository. **You can now log in to ArgoCD using your GitHub username, but you need to update RBAC for your account and your GitHub OAuth app in your GitHub organization.**
